👋 Hi, I’m @mchowdhury19
I’m a passionate Electrical Engineering major at San Jose State University, with a strong love for coding, problem-solving, and creating innovative tools. I also enjoy drawing and painting in all mediums, and 
I bond with people over food from different cuisines! 🍳🎨

👀 I’m interested in:
Software development: Particularly using Python and PyQt5 to build functional and user-friendly applications.
Making games: I love creating games in Python and using Pygame to bring fun ideas to life.
Electrical Engineering: Working on projects that bridge the gap between hardware and software.
Creative coding: Exploring how I can apply art and design principles to coding projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced Python techniques, particularly in GUI development with PyQt5.
More about embedded systems and FPGA programming.
New cooking techniques and exploring global cuisines! 🍝🍣

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
Projects related to Python, GUI design, or engineering tools.
Open-source projects that involve hardware/software integration.
Game development projects or collaborations in Pygame.
Cooking and food-related creative projects (seriously, who doesn’t love food?!).
