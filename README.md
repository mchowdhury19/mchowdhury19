👋 Hi, I’m Mahjabin!
I’m a new grad and Functional Electrical Engineer with a deep love for coding, problem‐solving, and crafting innovative tools. I enjoy drawing and painting in all mediums, and I connect with people over different cuisines 🍳🎨

👀 I’m interested in:
Software development: Building functional and user‐friendly apps, especially with Python and PyQt5
Game creation: Bringing fun ideas to life with Python and Pygame
Electrical Engineering: Projects that bridge hardware and software
AI/ML research: Specifically applying artificial intelligence to embedded systems 🤖🧠
Creative coding: Combining art, design, and technology

🌱 I’m currently learning:
I’m exploring Field Application Engineering 🤝, semiconductors 🔬, and embedded systems 🤖—especially AI in embedded hardware 🧠. When I’m not diving into circuits or code, I’m cooking new recipes 🍳 and discovering global cuisines 🌏!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
Python or GUI design projects
Open‐source engineering tools (hardware/software integration)
Game development projects (Pygame, etc.)
Creative food‐related collaborations (who doesn’t love good food?!)
